##proposal

###goals
	- use sentiment time-series to describe and find emotional narratives
	- explain variability in sentiment time-series and language/narratives
	- compare clinton's speech to trump's, past
	- have narratives changed over time

###to do
	- investigate outlier in speech sentiment time-series
	- investigate language in speeches corresponding to local extrema in sentiment time-series
	- analysis of speeches grouped by party and whether party was incumbant or challenger
	- predict sentiment based on incumbancy and basic economic data (unemployment, interest rates, stock market)
	- group/graph speeches with their PC


###other analyses
	- apply basic NLP tools: word/bigram/trigram counts
	- the speeches are relatively short, meaning it may not be difficult to employ grammar comprehension/POS tagging
	- topic modeling 
	- compare to utopian and authoritarian texts such as 
		rand
		the prince
		1984
		communist manifesto
